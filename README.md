# Radar Intercept Dashboard & MAYURI Threat Detection System 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains two integrated defense-oriented systems:

1. **Radar Intercept Dashboard** – A simulation-based dashboard for radar monitoring, target tracking, trajectory analysis, and interception planning.
2. **MAYURI** – An intelligent drone-based surveillance system that identifies threat levels by detecting humans, weapons, and illegal activities using computer vision and AI.

These systems are designed for **research, academic projects, and defense technology demonstrations**.

## 🛰️ Radar Intercept Dashboard

### 🔍 Description
The Radar Intercept Dashboard simulates real-time radar operations to detect, track, and intercept aerial targets such as drones or hostile objects. It provides advanced visualization, trajectory prediction, and interception planning with customizable control mechanisms.

### ✨ Key Features
- 📡 **Radar Simulation** – Simulated radar environment for target detection and tracking  
- 🧭 **Path Finder** – Calculates optimal paths for interceptor systems  
- 🛸 **Drone Trajectory Finder** – Predicts drone movement based on speed and direction  
- 📈 **Trajectory Generation** – Generates target and interceptor trajectories  
- 🎯 **Interception Point Calculation** – Identifies the most efficient interception point  
- 🎛️ **Customized Controls** – User-defined parameters for speed, range, and response  
- 💣 **Hard Kill** – Physical neutralization (missile/interceptor simulation)  
- 📡 **Soft Kill** – Non-kinetic countermeasures (jamming, spoofing, signal disruption)  

### 🧠 Use Cases
- Defense system simulation  
- Counter-drone strategy modeling  
- Research and academic demonstrations  
- Training and visualization of interception logic
